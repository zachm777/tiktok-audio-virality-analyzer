# Audio Virality Analyzer

Welcome to the Audio Virality Analyzer project! This is my first GitHub project where I'll be exploring machine learning and data analysis to understand which audios have the potential to go viral on social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube Shorts.

## Overview
In this project, I aim to analyze popular audios from TikTok and YouTube Shorts to identify patterns that correlate with viral content. I'll be using Python for data scraping, TensorFlow for machine learning, and eventually build a website where users can search for audio clips with high viral potential.

## TikTok Data Scraper
The first step of the project involves creating a TikTok data scraper. This Python script will extract information about popular audios from TikTok and analyze the associated videos' interactions, such as likes, shares, and comments.

## Machine Learning Model
To be added!

### Requirements
Python (Version 3.9)
bs4 - BeautifulSoup
requests
selenium

**How to Use:**
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure the selenium driver path is set to your machine's (Chrome specifically)

**Progress**
As of now, I have completed the TikTok data scraper. It's functional and extracts data from TikTok. I'll be continuously working to improve its efficiency and accuracy as the project moves forward.

## Next Steps
In the upcoming stages of the project, I'll be working on:
Building a machine learning model using TensorFlow to analyze the collected data and predict the "virality level" of each audio clip.
Developing a website that allows users to search for audios with potential for going viral and finding specific audios within their niche.
